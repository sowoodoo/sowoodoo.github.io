The argument supports a notion that the Church should recognize its part in the protection of rights and freedoms due to its foundational influence on democratic institutions. To understand this position fully, it is necessary to grasp the historical context that gives rise to the contemporary western conception of liberty and freedom. The church’s influence on framing governments and laws as well as its role in advocating for social justice will be assessed. In particular, the positions of Pope Francis and Martin Luther King Jr. will be referenced to substantiate the assertion that the Church should take responsibility for promoting civil liberties.\nHistorical context: Faith and Founding of Western Democracies To comprehend the significance of the church in the development of modern civil liberties, one must consider the historical context. The Biblical roots of some tenets in democratic thought cannot be undermined (Hauerwas 521). For instance, the notions of human dignity, equality, and liberty are pervasively present in religious teachings and became pivotal in the establishment of representative, secular governments in the West. Many of the founding fathers of American democracy, like Jefferson or Madison were deeply invested in their faith, which shaped their worldview, including the framework of a constitutional republic (Banner). As such, the Christian faith community played an influential and integral role in the formulation of institutions designed to protect individual liberties.\nThe Church Influence on Framing Governments and Laws Over the course of history, the Church has been a key player in shaping social, political, and legal systems. It stimulated the humanitarian aspects of the medieval welfare system and advocated for the eradication of the feudal-like ‘servitude’ which facilitated the birth of the concept of inalienable human rights. Since then, the Christian faith community has influenced legislation that guarantees freedom of conscience, speech, and assembly among others. The church has also supported grassroots movements for social reform, emphasizing their inherent call to heal societal wounds. For example, Martin Luther King Jr. sought inspiration in the Christian teachings to argue passionately against segregation and for a better America, where the principles of equal opportunity and justice under the law for all could find true realization.\nPope Francis and the Call to Justice Pope Francis represents the continuum of the church’s active engagement with the pressing issues of our time. He has consistently spoken out about the disregard of many of the basic human rights – social justice, equality, and protection of the vulnerable groups being high on the list. For instance, he has called on world leaders to act towards addressing global climate change as a moral issue and expressed his position against the indefinite detention of refugees, thus reinforcing the church’s historic commitment to challenging injustice. Notably, his actions do not just focus within the confines of the faith community but extend to the broader public discourse, an indication that the Church takes the role of protecting civil liberties seriously.\nConclusion In conclusion, the origins of the western civil liberties system bear profound ties to the Christian faith community whose influence abounded in the formation of democratic governments and institutions. Through significant events, from combating institutionalized inequalities in the Middle Ages to participating in progressive social changes during the Enlightenment and the civil rights movement, the Church demonstrated its ability and readiness to contribute to the safeguarding of human rights and freedoms. Today, leaders such as Pope Francis remind us of the enduring call to combat injustice and protect those most vulnerable. Thus the Church, mindful of its rich, people-changing history, ought to continue to accept responsibility for upholding the ideals it helped put into place – civil liberties and the freedoms they entail.\nWorks Cited\nBanner, Mark A.
