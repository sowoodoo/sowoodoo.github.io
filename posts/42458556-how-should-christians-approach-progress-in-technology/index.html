In our day and age, many people view technological progress as inevitable, a natural consequence of human nature. The opinion is not unanimously shared but it seems to be particularly pervasive among tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs who tend to support disruptive and transformative technological innovations. Conversely, a number of critics are alarmed at the pace of technological progress, fearing either that we lose control over the technology or even allowing for the possibility of supernatural involvement. Both camps can appeal to some Biblical passages. However, I believe that Christians should have a more balanced approach to the question.\nA balanced approach would recognise that as image-bearers of God we were des igned to exercise dominion over creation (Genesis 1:26-28) while also acknowledging the fallen nature of the world, which results in corruption and thorns (Genesis 3). Thereby, we must consider the potential benefits and dangers of the new technologies and submit them to the authority of Scripture and the lordship of Christ. In this article, I want to suggest several key principles, upon which a Christian perspective on technological progress might be built.\nWe Must Recognise that Technological Advancements are Part of God’s Common Grace Firstly, we need to see technological advancements within the wider context of God’s common grace. Common grace is God’s goodness displayed toward the whole of humankind and Creation itself, through which God ensures the continuity of the created order. The beneficial fruit of the technological advances humans make is a manifestation of God’s wisdom and benevolence in establishing a cosmos where our practical intelligence could flourish and develop to meet our needs.\nFor the Reformed tradition, a helpful way to phrase the idea of common grace is the way Karl Barth expressed it when he said, ‘In all his creatures and whatever pertains to them, whether realms of nature or histories of men, God gives good things.’[1] The sun, the law of gravity, photosynthesis and indeed, scientific progress, all embody the loving kindness of our Creator to bless and sustain His world.\nIt should come as no surprise then that believers, together with the rest of humanity, can contribute towards developing new and exciting technologies. This contribution should not be isolated from personal obedience and submission to God’s revealed will. However, what may be surprising is how often this basic theological starting point is neglected in popular discourse. More than once, out of a lack of understanding of the nature of common grace and the role of natural law in the order of the universe, the technological advancement is viewed as something alien and possibly sinister. With gratitude in mind, Christians should view the tech developments as yet another instance of the common grace at work in the world.\nWe Need to Be Vigilant for Unintended Consequences The second principle concerns the unpredictability of human affairs and the necessity of prudence and vigilance. Just as the wheel and fire, once harnessed, can be used for both benefit and harm, so too with more modern technological advancements like AI, gene editing or autonomous vehicles. While offering wondrous opportunities and saving lives, there is a real danger these advancements may be misused and bring about grave evil.\nThis is why in addition to embracing the potential benefits, Christians must actively engage with the questions that science and technology raise. They must participate in dialogue about the ethics of research and deployment, seek to develop technologies for the common good and call governments and corporations to responsible use of technology.\nPrecautionary principle (also known as precautionary approach or principle of anticipated safety), although contested by many economists and social scientists, might provide an appropriate framework for Christian thinking about the unintended consequences. As a rule of thumb, Christians should take responsibility not to harm through technological action before full scientific certainty of its outcome, especially in the case of irreversible damage. It is a deep commitment to care for the created order (Genesis 2:15) as well as a form of practical wisdom called for in Proverbs 3:21, “They failed to hate evil, and evil persisted in the land.” This kind of attentiveness to the future implications of the present actions is part of being God's people today, seeking the Kingdom to come on earth as it is in heaven.\nWe Are Called to Strive for Flourishing for All Thirdly, as Christians, we should seek the common good. At the heart of the biblical narrative is God’s plan for the shalom, the flourishing of His people and His world. In a nutshell, the Gospel is about redeeming this world and the redemptive process means working to restore this good order in all areas of life, including that of technology. In a sense, the market economy and innovation are part of that common call to seek human wellbeing and to steward the resources given to us.\nFor Christians then, not only individual technological projects are important but also the way those enterprises fit into broader economic systems and their distribution of benefits. In this light, the Christian community should encourage businesses to consider their impact on society and care for the underprivileged.\nJames K. A. Smith’s notion of cultural liturgies is instructive here. According to Smith, cultural practices are habits that shape our desires, habits and identities. By engaging in technological enterprise guided by the gospel, we may transform technology into one more of the avenues for communicating the good news of God's kingdom, drawing others into fellowship with him.\nIn Conclusion To summarise my argument, a Christian approach to technological progress should be built on a few key principles. First, a recognition of the technological progress as part of God’s common grace, second, a sober awareness of the unintended consequences and the need for vigilance and the thirdly, a commitment to the flourishing for all people – to work in the quest for shalom. May the Lord guide us in the ways of wisdom as He shepherded His people in the age gone by.\n[1] Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics, IV:1, pp. 470-471 (Edinburgh: T\u0026T Clark, 1957).\nRev.
