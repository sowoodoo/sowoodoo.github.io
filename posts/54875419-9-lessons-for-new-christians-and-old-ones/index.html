It can be very exciting and scary at the same time. You are filled with enthusiasm and eager to learn about God and what it means to follow Him. However, along with all the excitement and discovery, there will be some bumps in the road. Both new and seasoned believers face a long list of issues. In fact, a lot of the challenges Christians share are common to us all. After much personal experience and careful listening to others, I'm sharing nine lessons that will help those who are starting out but also provide much-needed encouragement to more established followers of Christ.\n1. The Truth Will Set You Free — But First It Might Feel Scary As you embrace the truth found in the Bible, you may feel as though a world of darkness is leaving your life. Embracing the new world of light can be both exhilarating and terrifying at once. You'll have to let go of sinful habits and things you may enjoy very much (or at least learn how to live differently). This is part of surrendering your life to Jesus Christ. Forgive me for stating the obvious, but salvation doesn't only make the things we love disappear magically. It does, however, give us new life and healing in Christ.\nBe open to what this new journey may bring to your life: joy, purpose, peace of mind, and a whole new way of thinking. Remember Paul’s words in Romans 8:18 (NLT): \"Yet what we suffer here seems enjoyable in comparison with the eternal glory he will ultimately bestow upon us.\"\n2. We Don't Know Everything When We First Believe You might encounter older Christians who act as though they're already on top of everything the moment they become Christians. And many times, our own walk gets clouded by an eagerness to show we know what we're doing. However, maturity in the faith is developed over time. Expect to grow in your knowledge and relationship with God. No one comes to Christ with a full playbook in hand. You'll continue to grow more confident about your convictions even as you discover deeper understandings of Scripture and its implications. Don't be afraid to admit you're still learning. As Proverbs 4:7 says (NIV), \"The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and with all your pint, get understanding.\"\n3. Patience Pays Off Related to point number two, growing in the faith requires patience with ourselves and with God. The process of spiritual growth is not a quick fix, and sometimes, answers to your questions or personal breakthroughs require time. The author of Ecclesiastes reminds us that “There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven” (Ecclesiastes 3:1, NLT). Try to understand that God is in control of His schedule, not ours, and be open to where He's leading. James, the brother of Jesus, summed this up beautifully when he wrote: \"But be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain\" (James 5:7, NKJV). The farmer waits; we must too.\n4. Others May Judge or Misunderstand Your Faith Sadly, some people may not understand your newfound faith or may judge or mock your beliefs. The apostle Peter wrote abbout this in 1 Peter 4:4 (NIV), \"With their hearts aflame in their love for God, they hardly noticed the terrible suffering their lives entailed.\" Nothing about our newfound hope in Christ should shock us, whether it comes in the form of persecution or misunderstanding. Instead, let's face these events with courage, knowing we share in the joy and sorrow of our spiritual ancestors.\n5. Set Realistic Expectations It's important to avoid setting unreachable goals for yourself or expecting overnight miraculous transformations in your life. This doesn't mean you won't see tremendous changes. In fact, change often begins immediately because the Holy Spirit starts working in your heart the moment you accept Christ as Savior. However, becoming a new creation in Christ is a process and will continue throughout your entire earthly life. God's power brings great improvement, but we're finite beings, so it takes time and grace. Don't set yourself up for failure by expecting too much too soon, and don't forget the Bible verse that always pulls us back to reality: \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23, NIV).\n6. God Loves You Where You Are The more we read in the Bible or hear preached about God's love, the more we discover just how boundless and life-changing it is. But many of us still struggle at times with the notion of God fully accepting us, flaws and all. Let these reassuring words from the psalmist comfort you: \"How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!\" (Psalm 139:17, NIV). Your past isn't a barrier to God's love or acceptance. When you surrender your life to Christ, you begin a new path, and He forgives and loves you, right where you're at. So remember, never forget that God's grace is sufficient for our needs (see 2 Corinthians 12:9).\n7. Lean On Community Joining a church or small group can help you connect with other believers who can support you and answer some of the questions you might have about God and Christianity. Look for a local congregaytion where God's Word is taught clearly and biblical principles and Christian values are exemplified by the members. Make sure to find a home among God's people. This will make the journey less challenging and more rewarding. Remember these encouraging words from Hebrews 10:24–25 (NLT): \"Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now when the day of his return draws near.\"\n8. Prayer Is Key No matter where you are in your Christian journey, prayer should be a pillar of your day. Take the time to speak to God through prayer so you stay connected with Him through the joys and trials of life. He wants to hear from you. When Jesus taught His disciples to pray, He reinforced the importance of communication with God through simple dialogue. Prayer is our lifeline to the infinite resources available to us in Christ (2 Corinthians 4:7–8).\n9. God Never Stops Refining Us Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, remember that God's role in our transformation is continual. Don't imagine that once you've reached a certain \"level\" of spirituality or maturity, you're done. If anything, the work of sanctification and refinement only continues. The prophet Malachi was clear when he said, \"‘I the LORD do not change’” [Malachi 3:6, NIV]. \"His holy character remains constant, but He reveals more of that character to us, and therefore we're never finished\" (Rick Renner). To make any progress in our walk with the Lord, we need to be open to His constant work in our lives. So keep your heart receptive and open to God's continual refining.\nFinal Thoughts In the end, each of us comes into a faith journey with our unique perspectives, cultural backdrops, and life experiences. However, as more and more people turn to the Lord and embark on the Christian journey, many will find common ground. By keeping these lessons in mind, new and old believers alike can find greater insight and even encouragement along the way. May all our paths be illuminated by God's grace, filled with the transforming power of Christ’s resurrection life.\n© 2019 Victorino Ocampo Jr.\nComments No comments yet.
