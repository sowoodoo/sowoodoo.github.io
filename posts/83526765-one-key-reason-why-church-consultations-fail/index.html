Some fail to be effective at reaching people for Jesus Christ. To address this challenge, I have consulted with a good number of Christian organisations. In these strategic processes, it has often been my experience that well-intentioned attempts to improve may still stumble unnecessarily. Some may even come to a complete halt. Here is one critical factor in why church consultations may fail, which, if understood and addressed appropriately, can greatly help these efforts succeed.\nContext: The Complexities in Churches Churches, like any large human system, are highly complex. They contain a combination of various subsystems, such as leadership, congregation, facilities, finances, programs, and more. All those systems have their own intricate, interdependent dynamics. As a result, one action or decision may inadvertently ripple outward, unintentionally disrupting other important aspects in the church’s ecology. This reality makes change in a complex system like a church inherently difficult.\nMoreover, because churches are bodies of believers, they include elements of spirituality, theology, and emotion. Their inner workings are not simply a matter of mere management efficiency. Instead, these groups reflect both biblical and personal convictions and beliefs about how God is moving and what He is doing. This reality means that a church consultation, if not done carefully, can quickly become an exercise in power struggles, manipulation, theological controversy, or fearful reactions.\nFor churches to embrace a consultation constructively, there are crucial foundational aspects that must first be established. One key among them is the cultivating of appropriate vulnerability.\nVulnerability Defined On a basic level, vulnerability is the willingness to expose one’s weaknesses or issues. It requires humbling oneself before others, acknowledging shortcomings. As the well-known pastor and author, Tim Keller, observes “The ability to be vulnerable with those who represent varying points of view is an essential gift for leaders” (Keller, 2015) Acknowledging weaknesses is not a popular practice in much of today’s fast-paced, results-oriented business world. For churches however, embracing this practice is integral to their functioning.\nThis aspect of vulnerability is necessary for the successful progression of a church consultation. There are two important reasons why. First, it sets up the environment for trust, collaboration, and honest evaluation. Second, admitting vulnerability provides the setting where constructive improvement is possible since problems will not be ignored or discounted.\nFailure to Develop Appropriate Vulnerability Unfortunately, all too often, those accountable for church leadership or overall direction may not adequately demonstrate the willingness to be vulnerable. One of three scenarios typically arise in the consultation process that inhibit success:\nLeaders seeking consultation may hold an overdeveloped self-confidence, which becomes a cover for an unwillingness to engage in honest self-assessment. In such cases, they will resist truly owning any significant challenges their ministry faces. On other occasions, the responsible parties may err by overly relying upon their staff, ministry partners, or key supporters to acknowledge any existing problems or the need for change. By assigning the responsibility for what might be perceived as negative information to others, they can shirk their personal responsibility. Sometimes, church leaders may select external consultants who either lack credibility or are unwilling to push into real areas of concern. These leaders are seeking validation rather than genuine critical assessment. In all these situations, the absence of vulnerability is visible. As a result, no real progress in resolving underlying issues or capitalising on new opportunities can transpire. It is here that most church consultations fail. It is hard to move from the status quo when crucial leaders and decision-makers are unwilling to first admit the necessity of change.\nThis issue is not just theoretical. It is something I have witnessed on numerous occasions. If church leaders are not open to evaluating the hard and soft data of the situation, and are not prepared to look honestly at weaknesses and the impact these may be having on effectiveness, then any attempt at consulting is significantly undercut from the beginning.\nHow to Cultivate Vulnerability When facing a new church consultation, the following steps can aid in creating the right atmosphere for positive progress:\nEncourage individual leaders to openly examine the state of their particular area of responsibility. Encourage them to publicly discuss any worries or questions they might have about the overall health of the organisation. If they cannot muster this courage themselves, as part of the consultation process, purposefully build time and space for this to occur. Emphasise team engagement in the process. Ensure a respectful, non-confrontational environment. The aim is to create a feeling that everyone is working together to find solutions and not playing winners or losers. Make external consultants understand their role is to provide wise counsel, not a rubber-stamp of the client’s preferred solution. They should be hired on the basis of both the technical competence needed for the consultation task, but also an evidence of character, trustworthiness and understanding of the unique nature of a church. Recognise and appreciate any admission of vulnerability. Ensure appropriate public responses that reinforce the value of such candour. This helps to model this behavior for others. Ultimately, the foundational starting point for the success of any church consultation is the development of appropriate vulnerability. It is critical that responsible leaders be the first to demonstrate their personal willingness to expose faults or admit the need for transformation. By so doing, they will, at once, build trust, engender healthy self-criticism and create an environment where true progress can happen.\n","wordCount":"911","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-27T17:55:12Z","dateModified":"2024-02-27T17:55:12Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://sowoodoo.github.io/posts/83526765-one-key-reason-why-church-consultations-fail/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"So Woodoo","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://sowoodoo.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://sowoodoo.github.io/ accesskey=h title="So Woodoo (Alt + H)">So Woodoo</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">One Key Reason Why Church Consultations Fail</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-27 17:55:12 +0000 UTC'>February 27, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Context: The Complexities in Churches">Context: The Complexities in Churches</a><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Vulnerability Defined">Vulnerability Defined</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Failure to Develop Appropriate Vulnerability">Failure to Develop Appropriate Vulnerability</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="How to Cultivate Vulnerability">How to Cultivate Vulnerability</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>In the not-for-profit world, many ministries and churches do not operate efficiently.
