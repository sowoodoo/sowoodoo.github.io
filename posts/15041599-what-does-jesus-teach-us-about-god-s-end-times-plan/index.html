But, we can turn to the greatest end-times Teacher -- Jesus Himself.\n\"Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day [Jesus' return] will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction.\" 2 Thessalonians 2:3\nThe Bible's book of Matthew reveals an important question the disciples asked Jesus concerning the end times. It is here where Christians discover His teachings on end-times.\nA question arose among the disciples, who were troubled over what may have been widespread speculation about the end times and Jesus’ return. So they approached him, asking, \"Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” (‭Matthew‬ ‭24:3‬)\nThis question marked a significant opportunity for the Lord to pass on His thoughts and understanding of end-time events. However, we should also remember, as these truths unfolded, the disciples often didn't receive a complete understanding right away.\nHence, Jesus initially answered them about future persecutions and the eventual collapse of the Jewish Temple in A.D. 70 before turning to discuss other end-time matters.\nThe passage that follows provides a wealth of teaching material. We'll examine what it says about the concepts surrounding the end of the age; these concepts, though not exhaustive, are part of the foundational scriptural discourse on the topic.\nA Summary of Christ's End Time Teachings Future Disturbances and Wars: Jesus said there would be \"wars and rumors of wars\". War, violence, global unrest, and persecution of believers will increase, but these only serve as the beginning birth pangs, not the ending of the age. (Matthew 24:6-8).\nPseudo-Prophets, False Messiahs, and Skewed Spirituality: Deceivers and false prophets who mislead people in the name of Christ would arise. He warned against these false proclaimers, affirming many would follow their lead.(Matthew 24:5, 11,24).\nGlobal Proclamation: Gospel proclamation would expand across the globe and into every nation. This would not be a sign of the end, however, since this process continues until Jesus returns. The gospel's spread is, in fact, His promise and command for all believers (Matthew 24:14).\nNatural Disasters: Nature itself would experience turbulence. There would be earthquakes in strategic locations and massive disturbances in the heavens (perhaps referring to meteor showers or cosmic disturbances), but these also don’t signal the end is at hand. Instead, Jesus classifies these as \"birth pangs,\" just growing pains (Matthew 24:7).\nThe Rapture? This concept doesn't find a direct match in Matthew 24. Rather, following perils and suffering, Jesus speaks more broadly of \"his angels\" gathering up \"elect\" from all parts of the Earth. It seems this teaching points to a final judgment of souls but doesn't cover the 'rapture' (involving snatching believers away prior to tribulations). Some view this more as a catch-phrase symbolizing the Final Judgment.\nApocalypse, the Great Tribulation: Jesus forecasts a time of horrific testing called \"the great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now and never will be again\" (Matthew 24:21). These times of troubles presage the return of the Son of Man but don't define the end (Matthew 24:29, Luke 21:27)\nSecond Coming: In His answer, Jesus finally speaks directly of His second coming. People won't know the date or exact hour. However, the celestial events will signal the event (Matthew 24:36,30, Mark 13:32), echoing Old Testament prophecies on signs in the heavens (Isaiah 13:10, Jeremiah 10:2).\nThe Final Judgment: After His arrival, the risen Christ will appoint Judges (probably his angels) \"to gather out the weeds [wicked] and to burn them with fire, and he will gather the wheat [believers] into his barn.\" (Matthew 13:30). Jesus later clarifies that \"everyone who has listened to the teaching of the kingdom and hasn't lived guilty lives, these will shine like stars forever in heaven\" (Matthew 25:33-46). This presents a picture of divine judgment - rewarding the faithful and punishing the wicked, constituting the \"end\" of the era under discussion.\nIn conclusion, the primary takeaways from Christ's words include both foreboding dangers and hopeful anticipation. Human history will continue to be marked by warfare, natural catastrophes, and even a surge in erroneous spiritual movements. However, those who remain true to Christ will find vindication, with \"the ending of the age\" culminating in the dramatic, visible and universal reappearance of Jesus.\n© 2019 Rajesh Nrithyanandan\nComments No comments yet.
