What about the trials that shatter our notions of a good, powerful, loving God?\nIn times of overwhelming loss or betrayal, it may feel like your faith in God is the first casualty. However, these very moments can be the crucible for building greater confidence and trust in our heavenly Father than ever before.\nHere are four keys to build confidence in God as life falls apart.\n1. Let Suffering Stir Your Questions, Not Quit Your Faith There's an ncient proverb that says trouble comes to test the metallurgy of our souls.\nWhen life crumbles into a million pieces before us, it's natural to question why. C.S. Lewis wrote in his book A Grief Observed about his wife's death, \"My fairy godmother had flunked.\" To Lewis, his belief in God didn't hold up against the dark curtain of grief.\nBut Job, the Old Teestament hero who suffered immeasurably, offers a different perspective. While he raged and questioned God's actions, even asserting he'd speak truth to him from his misery (Job 6-7), he never gave up on Yahweh. In fact, by the final chapter of his story, Job rejoiced in God's goodness despite the suffering he endured.\nYes, we need to ask the hard questions of faith - and even be enraged at times. But, like Job, don't quit your faith during life's storm.\n\"You will keep the mind that turns to you unreproachable.\" Psalm 19:13 (NLT)\nTrust begins when doubt and fear rub elbows with hope. As author Richard Rohr asserts, \"Suffering does not destroy faith; it creates faith\" through the process. The alternative is quitting in despair or self-protection instead of letting faith grow amid the mess.\n2. Wrestle With Doubt but Don't Let It Become Your Comfort Zone In the darkest hours, we must grapple with the harsh disconnect between our understanding and God's ways (Isaiah 55:8-9). By engaging in the wrestling match, you're not denying your faith -- you're seeking answers that can birth new depth in your relationship with God.\nThe biblical patriarch Jacob spent a long night battling with the living God - not knowing he did so. He left limping, but also marked with a new name (Genesis 32:24-30) signifying the changed nature of his relationship with God. Few of us come away from the valley unchanged.\nUltimately, you must choose whether to settle in the wrestling match or allow the struggle to birth a closer confidence in God's ways and purposes.\n3. Embrace Mystery – Trust in Unseen Grace As you journey from faith crisis to restored hope, you'll need to embrace mystery. There are things about God that you just won't understand this side of heaven.\nChristian writer Marilyn Chandler McEntyre suggests that the mystery of grace is humbling and beautiful. In her book, Caring For Words, she notes how unseen grace works. You can't pinpoint its origin or control its application. Yet, it swirls around every living breath like a thousand angels whispering love and healing.\nSurrender your demands for black-and-white resolution to God's love and care. It's through embracing the mystery that we learn to rest in a hope greater than ourselves.\n\"Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power at work within us...\" Ephesians 3:20 (NIV)\n4. Look for New Growth After the Storm After the valley of darkness, new growth will emerge from the ashes. Christ's resurrection power works best in the smoldering cinders of life's worst pain.\nHebrews 12:7 compares life's struggles to the Father chastening His children: \"Endure your share of hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom a father does not discipline?\" In other words, as He whispers \"wait\" during life's darkest hours, Jesus and His Father promise ultimate redemption after the trial.\nThe road out of heartbreak brings new confidence in God because we've seen Him carry us through the impossible. Your faith grows roots in the fertile soil of suffering’s plowing, promising beauty in the midst of ashes. And that's God's way of saying, \"I’m here, and I’ve got your back.\"\nSo when life falls apart, know that God's greatest rewards often blossom on the scorched earth of your broken heart, bringing greater faith than you imagined possible.\nPhoto Credit: © Unsplash/William FitzSimmons\nClare Bruismann shares stories from real life in south Africa and beyond, stirring hearts to draw nearer to the God of all Salvation.
